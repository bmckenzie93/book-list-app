  I used skeleton to style the UI quickly for this project.

  This is exactly what I was trying to do with my portfolio piece, I knew I needed to make an object out of my inputs but I coulldnt figure out how to do it properly. I will try it this way now and I'm sure it will work. 

  Using ES6 classes makes the code a lot cleaner looking and easier to read
